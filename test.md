HORRARY, It's working!

https://hub.docker.com/r/danjellz/markdown2confluence/

This is the built in test for danjellz/markdown2confluence, calling a file that you mounted on the Docker container.

- What list?
- THIS LIST!

`monospace text `
``` bash
echo "Hello!"
```

This is some Ruby code.
``` ruby
User.first.update(admin: true)

# Variables and expressions.
a = 10
b = 3 * a + 2
printf("%d %d\n", a, b);

# Type is dynamic.
b = "A string"
c = 'Another String'
print b + " and " + c + "\n"
```
